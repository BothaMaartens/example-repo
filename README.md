The holiday.py program added to this repository is a program that was created earlier in the bootcamp as part of "M02T08 â€“ Programming with User-defined Functions". 

The program requests the user to select a holiday destination, the number of hotel nights and the number ofd car rental days. The program will then return a total budget for the holiday. 

Run this program in Python and follow the instructions to get the holiday budget.
